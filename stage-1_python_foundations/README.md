# Welcome to Stage 1: Python Foundations

This folder contains small, hands-on coding challenges designed to reinforce Python fundamentals. Each mini-project is designed to help me solidify basic concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, input/output handling, and modular thinking that are foundational to real world problem solving.

## Python Mini-Projects (Coding Challenges) included:
| Project Name       | Description                                               | Key Concepts Practiced                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Odd & Even Detector | Simple program to determine if a number is odd or even   | `input()`, `try/except`, conditionals    |
| Customizable FizzBuzz Generator    | Customizable FizzBuzz generator with user interaction     | functions, loops, modularity, validation |
| Basic Unit Converter          | Converts between units like kilometers/miles, °C/°F, etc. via menu options | input validation, function logic, string formatting |

## Learning Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills using basic Python syntax
- Learn modular programming by breaking code into reusable functions
- Build confidence in handling user input and validating edge cases
- Get used to reflection and writing project documentation
